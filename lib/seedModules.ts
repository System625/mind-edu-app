- Changes in appetite or weight
- Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping
- Loss of energy or increased fatigue

## Important to Know

Depression is **treatable**. Most people with depression get better with treatment, which may include:

- Therapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy)
- Medication
- Lifestyle changes

Stress and anxiety are normal responses to challenges in life. However, learning how to manage them effectively is crucial for your well-being.

## What's the Difference?

**Stress** is your body's response to a challenge or demand. It's usually temporary and goes away once the situation is resolved.

**Anxiety** is persistent worry or fear, even when there's no immediate threat. It can interfere with daily activities.

## Quick Stress Relief Techniques

### 1. Deep Breathing (4-7-8 Technique)
- Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts
- Hold your breath for 7 counts
- Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 counts
- Repeat 3-4 times

### 2. Grounding Exercise (5-4-3-2-1)
Identify:
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell

This brings you back to the present moment.`,

### Physical Activity
Regular exercise reduces stress hormones and releases endorphins (feel-good chemicals).

### Healthy Sleep Habits
Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep per night. Create a calming bedtime routine.

### Connect with Others
Talk to friends, family, or a counselor. Social support is powerful.

### Limit Caffeine and Sugar
These can increase anxiety symptoms.

### Practice Mindfulness
Even 5 minutes of meditation daily can help reduce anxiety.

## When Anxiety Becomes Too Much

If anxiety is interfering with your daily life, it's time to seek professional help. Treatment options include:

- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- Medication
- Relaxation techniques training
- Support groups`,

### Practice Gratitude

Ask yourself:
